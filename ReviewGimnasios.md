File Summary: Gimnasios.py
overview
This file defines the core logic for managing a gym system, encapsulated primarily in the Gimnasio class. The class provides comprehensive functionality for handling clients, memberships, trainers, special sessions, financial operations, and data import/export. It acts as the main business logic layer for a gym management application, coordinating the creation, modification, deletion, and analysis of all key entities (clients, trainers, sessions, memberships) and their interactions.

The file is designed to be interactive, with many methods prompting for user input when arguments are not provided, making it suitable for use in a command-line interface or as part of a larger application. It also integrates with other modules (Clientes, Sesiones, Utils) and handles persistence through text and JSON files.

key_components
Gimnasio Class:
The central class representing a gym, encapsulating all data and operations related to clients, trainers, sessions, and financials.

Client Management:
Methods for creating, searching, viewing, and deleting clients. Clients are stored in a fixed-size numpy array, and each client can have an associated membership.

Membership Management:
Methods to create, consult, pay, renew, and delete memberships for clients. Includes logic for handling payment status, expiration, and renewal.

Trainer and Session Management:
Methods to create, search, view, and delete trainers and special sessions. Trainers are associated with special sessions, and sessions can have clients enrolled.

Financial Operations:
Methods to record cash transactions (e.g., membership payments, single-entry payments), analyze financial data by month, and generate daily financial reports. Data is persisted in text files.

Reporting and Analysis:
Includes methods for:

Membership tracking (e.g., unpaid, expiring, expired, or missing memberships)
Financial analysis by month (income breakdown, daily stats)
Daily operational reports (entries, memberships sold, cash balance)
Entry analysis (entries by day of week and hour)
Data Import/Export:
Methods to export and import client and trainer data in both text and JSON formats, supporting backup and migration. Includes robust error handling and reporting for data loading.

User Interaction Patterns:
Many methods are interactive, prompting the user for input if required data is not provided, making the class suitable for CLI-driven workflows.

Integration with Other Modules:
Relies on external modules (Clientes, Sesiones, Utils) for entity definitions and utility functions, promoting modularity.

Persistence:
Uses text files for transaction and entry logs, and JSON for structured data export.

Validation and Error Handling:
Extensive input validation and user feedback throughout, with clear error messages and confirmation prompts for destructive actions.

This file is the backbone of the gym management system, providing all the necessary operations to manage the day-to-day activities, financials, and data of a gym in a structured and interactive manner.
